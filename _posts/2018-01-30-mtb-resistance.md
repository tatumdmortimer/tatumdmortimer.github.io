While most bacteria undergo lateral gene transfer, including other mycobacteria, *M. tuberculosis* evolves clonally. Most methods to detect positive selection were developed for eukaryotic, sexual species. To understand the effect of positive selection on patterns of diversity in a clonally evolving population, I examined drug resistance associated loci in natural populations of *M. tb* with both susceptible and resistant isolates. I found that resistance loci can be characterized by either diversifying selection with numerous rare variants present in the population or selection for a specific variant. We hypothesize that this difference is related to fitness costs associated with resistance mutations. I was able to capture known resistance determinants using measures of nucleotide diversity and population differentiation combined with identification of homoplastic sites, and I identified several novel loci with patterns of diversity similar to known loci, suggesting these genes are affected by positive selection and possibly involved in drug resistance.
