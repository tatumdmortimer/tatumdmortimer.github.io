Currently, gonorrhea is empirically treated with ceftriaxone and azithromycin dual therapy. However, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* has acquired resistance to these antibiotics, and the proportion of the gonocococcal
population resistant to azithromycin has been rapidly [increasing](https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats17/gonorrhea.htm). 
Macrolide resitance can be conferred by several mechanisms, including [mosaic MtrCDE efflux pumps](https://mbio.asm.org/content/9/4/e01419-18). Recently, Lyu, Moseng, and colleagues published 
a cryo-EM structure of mosaic MtrD bound to antibiotics in [*mBio*](https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/3/e00996-20). 
Additionally, they identified critical amino acid mutations within the mosaic sequence that lead to increased azithromycin MICs in isogenic mutants.

We wanted to know whether or not isolates with these mutations are circulating in natural *N. gonorrhoeae* populations and confer macrolide resistance in clinical isolates. Using a collection of 4852
*N. gonorrhoeae* genomes and MICs collected for our previous GWAS studies, we identified isolates with amino acid changes at MtrD 714 or 823, which did not encode mosaic alleles. These mutations were 
relatively rare; 12 and 7 isolates encoded mutations at positions 714 and 823, respectively. We found that mean azithromycin MICs in these isolates were higher than the CLSI breakpoint (>1 mg/L). 
Azithromycin MICs were significantly higher in isolates with these amino acid changes compared to their most closely related wild-type isolate in the dataset.
