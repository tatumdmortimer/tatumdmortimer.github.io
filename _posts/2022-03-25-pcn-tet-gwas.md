Point-of-care diagnostics for antimicrobial susceptibility of *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* are a promising tool to reintroduce previous gonorrhea treatment reginens into the clinic and reduce the increase of antimicrobial resistance in gonocococcal populations.
While a single locus target for ciprofloxacin susceptibility performs well, single loci do not predict susceptibility to other antibiotics.
For example, reistance to both penicillin and tetracycline can be acquired via plasmid-encoded or chromosomally-encoded mechanisms, and multiple loci contribute to chromosomally-encoded resistance.

In our study, we used conditional genome wide association studies (GWAS) to identify chromosomal loci that best predict penicillin or tetracycline susceptibility after controlling for the presence of plasmid-encoded resistance determinants.
For penicillin, we found that a combination of a sequence in *penA*, which represents the absence of both a mosaic *penA* allele and the absence of the resistance-associated insertion at codon 345, and the absence of *blaTEM* predicted susceptibility with high specificity. 
We also found that wild-type *rpsJ* codon 57 and the absense of *tetM* predicted tetracycline susceptibility with high specificity. 
Prediction of susceptibility using two loci had only moderate sensitivity, and the lab is working on follow up studies to assess the predictive power when additional loci are included.
