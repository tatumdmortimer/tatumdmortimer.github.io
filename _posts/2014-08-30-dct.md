Distributive conjugal transfer (DCT) is a mechanism of lateral gene transfer (LGT) first discovered in the nonpathogenic model organism *Mycobacterium smegmatis*. DCT is characterized by transfer of large, noncontiguous tracts of DNA from donor to recipient cells via cell contact, which produces transconjugant genomes that are mosaics of the parental strains. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) data from *M. smegmatis* transconjugants produced in experimental matings, I tested recombination detection software appropriate for bacterial WGS to identify the best methods to study recombination among mycobacterial populations. Additionally, I compared signatures of recombination produced by DCT to bacterial species with different mechanisms (e.g. natural transformation, mobile genetic elements), including length of tracts, recombination hot spots, and directionality of transfer. Using publicly available WGS data from clinical isolates of *Mycobacterium canettii*, I characterized recombination signatures and found that the signatures in *M. canettii* were most compatible with DCT. *M. canettii* and *M. smegmatis* are phylogenetically distinct; *M. canettii* is a slow growing pathogen closely related to *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, and *M. smegmatis* is a rapid growing mycobacterium closely related to other environmental species, suggesting that DCT is widespread across the genus.
