I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Immunology and Infectious Diseases at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. My research in Dr. Yonatan Grad's lab uses whole genome sequencing data from bacterial pathogens, primarily *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* and *Staphylococcus aureus*, to understand transmission, antimicrobial resistance, and adaptation to host environments. I'm currently on the job market looking for a faculty position in the southeastern United States!

I did my PhD at University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Microbiology Doctoral Training Program. Under the mentorship of Dr. Caitlin Pepperell, my graduate thesis centered on the impact of recombination and selection on the evolution of bacterial pathogens.
