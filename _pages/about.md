I am Assistant Professor in the Department of Population Health at the University of Georgia College of Veterinary Medicine. In my lab, we use genomics to understand the evolution and epidemiology of bacterial pathogens and develop precision diagnostics.

I did my PhD at University of Wisconsin-Madison in the Microbiology Doctoral Training Program. Under the mentorship of Dr. Caitlin Pepperell, my graduate thesis centered on the impact of recombination and selection on the evolution of bacterial pathogens. My postdoctoral research in Dr. Yonatan Grad's lab at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health used whole genome sequencing data from bacterial pathogens, primarily *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*, to understand transmission, antimicrobial resistance, and adaptation to host environments.
